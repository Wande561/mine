            Hi, I’m Mawande Hlangu!<br />
            I’m a web and game developer currently pursuing<br /> 
            a degree in Computer Science and IT. My passion lies<br /> 
            in creating immersive, interactive experiences through coding.<br /> 
            I’m particularly skilled in front-end design using HTML, CSS, and<br /> 
            JavaScript, and I’m expanding my expertise into TypeScript and React.<br /> 
            Recently, I’ve been working on my personal web page, using technologies<br /> 
            like Vite and Tailwind CSS to build something that reflects my skills and creativity.
        </p>
      <h2 className='text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900'> My Professional Goals</h2>
        <p className=" text-gray-600 mb-4 font-bold pt-5">
           I aim to continue growing my skills in web development,<br /> with a focus
           on user experience and design.<br /> My goal is to contribute to high-demand projects 
           in South Africa and all over the world,<br /> 
           combining my technical skills with a deep understanding of<br /> 
           users’ needs. Whether through freelance work or joining a team,<br /> 
           I’m excited to bring my knowledge to projects that make a difference.
